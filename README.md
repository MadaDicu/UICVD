## UICVD: A computer vision UI dataset for training RPA agents

The UICVD Dataset is a novel resource fostering advancements in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Computer Vision. It focuses on recognizing UI (User Interface) components of a web application which is not as well known as recognizing real objects in images in the field of computer vision. This dataset derives from extensive screen captures within an enterprise application, offering a rare, in-depth look at real-world automation and interface scenarios. Designed to support a wide spectrum of research and development initiatives, the UICVD Dataset is positioned as a critical asset for technology advancements in automation and user interface recognition. 

UICVD dataset has a total of 121 screenshots from an enterprise web application based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM and used within a multi-national software company.
